Clock is XTAL at 7.3728MHz

Column 1-6 scan at 40Hz, ~26us each.

LCD backlight PWM and beeper are at 3.597kHz.

Fuse Low Byte      = 0xaf
Fuse High Byte     = 0xc8
Fuse Extended Byte = 0xff
Calibration Byte   = 0x9f  --  Read Only

Differences between default and current fuse bits:
Fuse high byte:
	JTAG disabled
	CKOPT = 0
	BOOTRST = 0
Fuse low byte:
	Brown-out detector enabled
	CKSEL = 1111 (external crystal)
Startup time is chosen for ceramic resonator, slowly rising power.
